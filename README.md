An analysis of reward function of a hexapod robot
Research on reinforcement learning and robotics
Analyzed the reward function of hexapod robot model to obtain the efficient and stable locomotion
Optimal balance of reward parameters.
Reward parameters such as forward reward, lateral velocity cost, control cost, oreintation control, kinematic reward.
